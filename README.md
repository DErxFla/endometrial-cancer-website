# Endometrial-Cancer-Website
 
The EC Database is intended to be a resource, developed as part of a “Database” course project, designed to bring together genomic and transcriptomic knowledge related to endometrial cancer (EC). The aim is to serve as a central repository for researchers and clinicians, providing detailed data on genes, transcripts, and molecular components involved in the disease’s development and progression of the disease. 

In addition to genomic and transcriptomic data, the EC Database provides insights into the biological pathways that are disrupted in endometrial cancer. These pathways, extracted from KEGG, are critical for identifying disease mechanisms and potential interventions.
